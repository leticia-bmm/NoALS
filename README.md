# NoALS

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neuropathological disease that attacks, and slowly degenerates nerve cells from the brain and spinal cord. This disease affects motor neurons therefore, only affecting voluntary muscles, having no psychological repercussions. When the disease starts manifesting the first symptoms, people may start noticing problems walking, writing, or speaking. Symptoms most commonly develop between the ages of 55 to 70, with a male predominance. The causes of ALS are yet to be discovered, but they are thought to be genetic, epigenetic, environmental, or internal. Although there is no cure for this disease, if diagnosed and treated early, life expectancy is prolonged. This project is centered in creating a platform to enable a rapid detection for ALS.
